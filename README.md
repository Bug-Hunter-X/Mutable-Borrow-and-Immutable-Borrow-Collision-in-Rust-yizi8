This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust related to borrowing: attempting to create an immutable reference (&) to a variable that is already mutably borrowed (&mut).  The code in `bug.rs` showcases this issue. The solution in `bugSolution.rs` provides a way to fix this using different scopes or borrowing techniques. This is a crucial concept in understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
